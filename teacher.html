<!-- 

All you have to do to get hints working is....

* Break the word up into spans when it comes over the socket and you display it on the page
* Select the right span -- span#phoneme-0 
* And make it bounce with animateCSS
* Will take like 10 minutes
* UPDATE: took about an hour. not bad. 

* Then you need to make the curriculum generate a dictionary instead of a list of words
* That will take another half an hour
* Then you're almost done with this bit 
* Though you may also need to store the data in a different form, maybe output json. 
* UPDATE: That took about an hour. Maybe a little less bc I took a short break. 

* Now, you need to take a minute and make CSS work on both mobile and web. 
* Then you've got the basics working with hints even! Pretty cool! 

* Next, you'll need to make the algorithm for automatically selecting the next word
* Bet that takes an hour, then just a lot of tweaking to figure out the right way to do it
* UPDATE: Done. Only took an hour or two. 

* BUG: You need to fix this bug. You actually need to send the whole word to the student UI. Shit, that is not easy. You basically need to reconstruct words that have a grapheme like o-e. Super, duper not easy. Blah. Blah. Blah. Maybe not so bad. Just disable hints for those. Then all you have to do is reconstruct the word. Blah, tomorrow on that. 

* After that, see if you can get voice recognition working.

* Then multiple users at a time -- probably only take an hour. 

* Then onto the game that's upstream of this one. 

* Yeah, you've got a few weeks to get this done. But it's going to be sweet. Will make $10M this year on it.
