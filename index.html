    <h3>Quick start </h3>

    <p><a href="/student">Kids go here on a computer</a></p>
    <p><a href="/teacher">Parents go here on your mobile</a></p>



    <h3> What is this? </h3>

    <p>This is an early version of an app I'm building to teach 4-7 year-old kids to read. Thanks for helping me test it!</p>

    <h3>Aren't there already reading apps?</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, but they don't work. Either they're no fun, so you have to nag your kids to use it. Or they're hard to use so you're always having to help your child figure out how to use it. Or they simply don't teach your child anything except how to tap a screen.</p>

    <p>The final version will do 3 things really well:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Fun for kids to play — so you don't have to nag them</li>
      <li>Adapts to child's level — so they stay motivated and learn quickly</li>
      <li>Speech recognition — because you can't learn to read by tapping a screen</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I'm focused first on items 1 and 2. When we get those right, I'll move on to #3.</p>

    <p>
      Would love your feedback and ideas for how to improve. Text me anytime @ 650-773-2947.  -chris

    <h3>Is it right for my child?</h3> 

    <p>Can your child sound out the word "cat", but can't read books on their own yet? Then it's perfect!</p>


    <h3> How To Use It  </h3>

    <p>Voice recognition doesn’t work (yet!), so as a parent you’ll have to play that role for now. Here’s how:</p>
    <ol>

      <li><a href="/student">Kids go here on a desktop computer</a></li>
      <li><a href="/teacher">Parents go here on a mobile</a></li>
      <li>Tap the smiley face if they read the word correctly </li>
      <li>Don't let your child see you "grading" them -- they'll think the computer is doing it</li>
      <li>Use it for just 5 minutes a day.</li>
      <li>Expect your child to be reading books in 30-60 days</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>The Science (if you're interested!)</h3>

    <p>
      The key to becoming a great reader is to love reading. We all like things we're good at, so the key is to get kids to think of themselves as good readers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To do that, reading can't be drudgery. We have to quickly get kids the basics so they can read books of their choosing on their own. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're like me, you just have no idea how to progress to reading real books. But science shows it's easy if your child masters <b>150 foundational skills</b> — 100 sight words and 50 phonics rules. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Sight words</b> are common words like "I", "the", "there", etc.</p>
    <p><b>Phonics rules</b> are letter-sound combinations. For example, the "ee" in the word "need".</p>
    <p>By mastering the 150 foundational skills, your child will develop the ability to read 98% of the words in children's books. The 2% they don't understand, they'll learn to figure out from context.</p>
    <p>Other programs make one of two mistakes in teaching kids to read. Either they teach too many phonics rules (there are 181 in English), which makes learning to read drudgery. Or they don't teach enough phonics, which makes kids struggle when they try to read books, which makes them think reading is no fun.</p>
    
    <p>So when your child masters this game, they don't need any other reading program. Just give them books they want to read. They will naturally develop vocabulary and understanding.</p>
